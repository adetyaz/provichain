# ProviChain: Decentralized RWA Tokenization for Supply Chain (Powered by Massa Network)

### Introduction & Vision

**Vision:** To revolutionize global supply chains by providing a trustless, transparent, and highly automated platform for tokenizing physical goods as Real-World Assets (RWAs) on the Massa Network. ProviChain leverages Autonomous Smart Contracts (ASCs) for self-executing logistics, On-Chain Web Hosting for censorship-resistant access, and a dedicated "Product Launchpad" to streamline the onboarding of assets into the decentralized supply chain ecosystem.

**Core Value Proposition:** ProviChain offers verifiable authenticity, real-time tracking, automated condition-based actions (e.g., payments, re-routing), and enhanced liquidity for goods in transit or storage, moving beyond traditional track-and-trace to a truly "smart" and self-managing supply chain.

### Core Features

ProviChain is built around the following key features:

### The ProviChain Ecosystem Flow: How Features are Connected

The various features are interconnected to create a seamless, automated supply chain ecosystem:

1. **Product Onboarding (Launchpad to Core):**
   - An asset owner uses the **Product Launchpad (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4)** to submit their asset for tokenization.
   - Once vetted and configured, the Launchpad triggers the **RWA Tokenization Core (2.1)** to mint a unique NFT for the physical product on Massa.
   - The NFT is associated with **Autonomous Smart Contracts (3.2, 3.3, 3.4)** configured via the Launchpad's builder, defining its automated behavior.
2. **Supply Chain Operations (Core to Automation & UI):**
   - As the physical product moves, **Supply Chain Tracking & Event Management (3.1)** captures real-time IoT data and manual event logs (e.g., scanning at a checkpoint).
   - This data is fed to the **RWA Tokenization Core (2.2)** to update the NFT's metadata.
   - The updated data triggers **Autonomous Smart Contracts (3.2, 3.3, 3.4)**, which execute predefined logic (e.g., payment release, re-routing, quality alerts).
   - All these activities are reflected in real-time on the **On-Chain Hosted Dashboards (4.1)** for authorized participants and the **Public Product Verification Portal (4.2)** for consumers.
3. **Security & Access (DID/RBAC Across All):**
   - **Decentralized Identity (4.3)** is the backbone, ensuring all participants are authenticated.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (4.3)** governs who can perform specific actions (e.g., only a transporter can log a "shipped" event, only the asset owner can initiate an RWA tokenization).
4. **Decentralized Infrastructure (Underlying All):**
   - **Massa Network (5.1)** provides the foundational blockchain layer for all smart contract execution and data immutability.
   - **DeWeb Hosting (5.2)** and **Decentralized Storage (5.3)** ensure the entire platform's frontend and associated large files are resilient, censorship-resistant, and globally accessible.

### Proposed User Flows

##### User Flow: Tokenizing a New Product (Asset Owner)

1. **Access Launchpad:** Asset Owner (e.g., Manufacturer) navigates to `launchpad.provichain.massa` (open to change if url is not available).
2. **Login/Authenticate:** Connects Massa-compatible wallet, authenticates via DID.
3. **Start New Asset Submission:** Selects "Tokenize New Product" option.
4. **Provide Asset Details:** Fills out forms for asset type (e.g., "Luxury Watch Batch," "Agricultural Produce Container"), description, unique physical identifiers (serial numbers, batch IDs), initial ownership, and attachments (e.g., photos, initial certifications).
5. **Configure Smart Contract Logic (ASCs):**
   - Uses a visual builder to select and configure pre-built ASC templates for supply chain events.
   - _Example:_ "If `IoT.temperature > 25°C` for `4 hours` during `Transit` phase, THEN `TriggerAlert('Temperature Exceeded')` AND `InitiateClaimProcess('SpoilageInsurance')`."
   - Defines payment release conditions for suppliers/transporters.
6. **Legal & Compliance Attestation:** Reviews and digitally signs legal attestations (e.g., "I confirm legal ownership of this asset," "I understand SEC requirements").
7. **Submit for Vetting:** Submission is sent to the ProviChain platform for review by designated validators (may involve off-chain checks and on-chain attestations).
8. **Vetting & Approval:** Once approved (by designated validator accounts via signed on-chain transactions), the platform triggers the minting of the NFT.
9. **NFT Minted & Product Live:** A unique NFT is minted on Massa for the product/batch. The Asset Owner receives the NFT in their wallet. A public `product.provichain.massa/[NFT_ID]` portal is automatically generated.
10. **Begin Supply Chain Journey:** The physical product now has its digital twin on Massa, ready for tracking.

##### User Flow: Tracking a Product & Automated Action (Logistics Provider / Buyer)

1. **Product Initiates Journey:** The tokenized product leaves the manufacturer.
2. **IoT Data Stream:** Integrated IoT sensors on the physical product continuously send data (GPS, temp, humidity) via an oracle to the NFT's associated smart contract on Massa.
3. **Event Logging:**
   - **Logistics Provider:** When the product arrives at a checkpoint (e.g., port, warehouse), the Logistics Provider accesses `dashboard.provichain.massa`, authenticates, finds the NFT, and logs the event "Arrived at [Location]" with a digital signature.
   - **Customs Official:** (Future) A customs official logs "Cleared Customs" after inspection.
4. **ASC Execution:**
   - **Condition Met 1 (Payment):** As "Arrived at Destination" is logged and confirmed by GPS data via oracle, an ASC automatically releases the payment for the transportation service to the Logistics Provider's wallet.
   - **Condition Met 2 (Quality Control):** If sensor data indicates a critical temperature breach, an ASC automatically triggers an alert to the buyer and initiates an insurance claim process, updating the NFT's status to "Potential Damage, Claim Initiated."
5. **Buyer Verification:** The Buyer can scan a QR code on the physical product, which links to its `product.provichain.massa/[NFT_ID]` portal. They see the entire immutable journey, including real-time sensor data, logged events, and any automated actions taken by ASCs.
6. **Final Delivery & Ownership Transfer:** Upon final confirmed delivery (e.g., buyer's signed attestation on-chain), an ASC automatically transfers the NFT ownership to the Buyer's wallet.

#### Steps Beyond MVP

- **Oracle Integration:** Connect to real IoT data streams (limited resources is the reason for simulated data stream during building phase).
- **Advanced ASCs:** Implement more complex conditional logic for automated actions.
- **Decentralized Identity:** Integrate a robust DID solution.
- **Fractionalization & DEX:** Build the secondary market.
- **Full Launchpad:** Add full vetting workflows, ASC builders.
- **Scale:** Optimize for higher transaction volumes and broader RWA categories.
- **Product Tokens:** Launch of tokens and memecoins for products.
